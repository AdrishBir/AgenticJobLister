Future Enhancements
Integrate Selenium for scraping JavaScript-heavy pages.

Add a web interface for human review and correction of extracted data.

Implement detailed analytics to track extraction accuracy over time.

Enhance caching and rate limiting as needed.

Security Best Practices
API Key Management: Store API keys in environment variables and never hard-code sensitive information.

Error Handling: All modules include comprehensive error handling and logging.
